In war, the soldiers who build bridges, repair roads, clear minefields and conduct demolitions — all under combat conditions — are known as *sappers*.

For web developers, the stakes are generally lower than those for combat engineers. But we face our own hostile environment: underpowered devices, poor network connections, and the complexity inherent in front-end engineering. Sapper, which is short for <strong>S</strong>velte <strong>app</strong> mak<strong>er</strong>, is your courageous and dutiful ally.
